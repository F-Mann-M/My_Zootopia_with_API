# My Zootopia with API:
This project prompts the user to enter an animal, fetches data about animals that contain the entered term in their name from an API 
The generated html contains a list of these animals and some characteristics.

## Usage
To generate the html 
1. execute animals_web_generator.py
2. enter an animal name like fox or monkey.
3. the program generates a html called animals.html

If no content for the entered name is found in the API, you will receive an error message.
Just try another name :)
